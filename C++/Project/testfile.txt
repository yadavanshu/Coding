File Compression Tool
=====================

This tool demonstrates a simple file compression structure.

How to Use:
-----------
1. To compress a file, run the tool and provide the filename.
2. The tool will create a compressed file with the `.comp` extension.

3. To decompress the file, run the tool again and provide the compressed filename.
4. The tool will create a decompressed file with the `.decomp` extension.

Example Usage:
--------------
To compress:
$ ./file_compression_tool filename.txt

To decompress:
$ ./file_compression_tool filename.txt.comp


Simple File Encryption/Decryption Tool
========================================

This tool demonstrates basic file encryption and decryption using XOR.

How to Use:
-----------
1. To encrypt a file, run the tool and provide the filename and a single character key.
2. The tool will create an encrypted file with the `.enc` extension.

3. To decrypt the file, run the tool and provide the encrypted filename and the same key used for encryption.
4. The tool will create a decrypted file with the `.dec` extension.

Example Usage:
--------------
To encrypt:
$ ./file_encryption_tool filename.txt key

To decrypt:
$ ./file_encryption_tool filename.txt.enc key
